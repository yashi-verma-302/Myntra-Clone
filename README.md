#Myntra Clone

The Myntra Clone is a frontend web development project that seeks to replicate the user interface and core features of the popular online fashion e-commerce platform, Myntra. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive shopping experience for users. By emulating the functionality and design of Myntra, our goal is to provide a seamless and user-friendly shopping platform for fashion enthusiasts.


## API Reference

The Myntra Clone frontend project does not directly interact with external APIs or backend services. The data displayed on the frontend is simulated using JSON data or locally stored data. However, to integrate the frontend with a backend, APIs can be developed based on RESTful principles to handle user authentication, product retrieval, and other server-side functionalities.
